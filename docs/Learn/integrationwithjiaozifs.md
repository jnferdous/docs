You can use JiaoZiFS with a wide range of tools and frameworks.

JiaoZiFS provides several clients directly, as well as anÂ [S3-compatible gateway](https://docs.lakefs.io/understand/architecture.html#s3-gateway). This gateway means that if you want to use something with JiaoZiFS, so long as that technology can interface with S3, it can interface with JiaoZiFS.

See below for detailed instructions for using different technologies with JiaoZiFS.
